# LinAlg
Simple Linear Algebra Class for Java, mostly with Static Methods

### How to use
Just download the class and use it in your project. No external dependencies.

### What is included
Matrix inversion, multiplication, subtraction, factorization, transpose, and more

### Perfomance
LinAlg aims for simplicity, but in the small benchmarks I ran it outperformed Matlab by a wide margin!

### Known bugs
The QR factoring method needs to be improved for rectangular matrices
